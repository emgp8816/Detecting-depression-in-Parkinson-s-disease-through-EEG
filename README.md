# Detecting-depression-in-Parkinson-s-disease-through-EEG
EEG was used to analyze the difference of frequency components between patients with Parkinson's disease and people diagnosed with depression. These two pathologies affect the cortical cortex of the brain, and it is not clear how to distinguish them, so there is a tendency to suffer from depression if you have Parkinson's. The spectral analysis of the EEG signals was used to create a system that distinguishes between both anomalies, applying linear predictive methods and the correlation that exists between the data through the Mahalanobis distance.
